## Beta Version 1.4 Todos

* Override css to enfore true dark mode.
  - No choice with my app, force darkmode!
  - See example from intra site.

* Add check for update on sucessful user login.
  - Make update.sh take a -n check dryrun flag to bail out if an update is
    available but don't actually update.

* Think about implementing reaper daemon thread to cleanup lingering watch
  processes if output route hasn't been requested recently.
  - Currently I'm using requests for other routes to kill the daemonized watch
    processes if output hasn't been requested recently.
    - This has the downside of leaving a watch process running if someone
      closes app directly by just leaving the live console output on the
      controls page.

* Create mechanism for exempting certain controls for certain game servers.
  - For example, the Update and Console commands for the Battlefield 1942
    server don't do anything.
    - They're not recognized by that lgsm server and so they just print the
      help menu.
      - Not terrible but just not polished.
  - Instead, I want to somehow hardcode exceptions like that, maybe via another
    json file with a list of game server exceptions. Then those options wont
    even be loaded on the page.

* Solve SSL issue.
  - Direct users to [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/).
  - Write up documentation, possible make setup video.

* Update Readme.
  - Include gifs instead of images for each of the pictures.

* Improve documentation.
  - Write up more detailed documentation about:
    - Editing the config
    - Editing the json files
  - Create video tutorials for install
    - Possible make one for hooking into Nginx Proxy Manager

* Continue expanding tests.
  - Write proper tests for a full game server install.
    - Install Battlefeild 1942 or something small.
    - Check that daemon thread is running during install.
    - Check that output api is returning json.
      - Rinse and repeat for command(s) on controls page.
      - Can't test daemon thread till real server is installed.
  - Write unit tests for functions in utils.py file.

## Beta Version 1.5 Todos

* Allow web interface to work with lgsm installations owned by different users.
  - Add config / settings option to "allow installs owned by other users".
  - I'm thinking doing this by creating a web-lgsm group and chowning the
    necessary game server dir to be `other_user:web-lgsm`.

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feezable /
  worthwhile.
