## Beta Version 1.8.0 Todos

### v1.8.0 Pt 1.
---

* \/\/\/ THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK \/\/\/

* ~Make sure post auto install removes new users rootless sudo access.~
  - ~Playbook has to add this for auto install as new users to work correctly.~
  - ~But if its not cleaned up afterwards, could be bad.~

* I Need to rethink things related to this passwordless auto install.
  - In trying to accomplish the above todo, I realized a pretty fundamental
    problem with the new approach, which I should've noticed earlier, but ehh
    live and learn.
  - Basically, it would appear, the main thread that launches the ansible
    playbook to setup the required auto install sudoers rules, cannot also be
    then use those sudoers rules right after adding them.
    - This is so dumb, but yeah any other process launched not by the same
      thread can make use of those sudoers rules just fine. The rules are valid
      and they work.
    - But since its the same thread that creates them, it appears, it cannot
      then make use of those sudoers rules.
    - So that's fun...
  - The real problem here is I've basically stretched the original logic to its
    limits and unsurprisingly it broke.
    - Previously the install page was just had to be responsible for running
      the main auto install script.
    - But really it now needs to be able to run three separate stages back to
      back.
      - Pre-install
      - Auto-install
      - Post-install
    - Each stage depends on the others finishing successfully.
    - Cleanup needs to happen if the stage before fails.
    - Also as we've seen, it doesn't appear we can use the sudoers rule in the
      same thread after we add them.
  - As for how to solve it, I kinda have two rough ideas.
    - Option 1 - The hacky way.
      - Put the whole install in one playbook and find some way to hackily pull
        out the auto install cmd stdout & stderr in realtime.
      - There's an ansible async poll thing that might be able to use, but not
        sure if I can get stdout of that yet.
      - Maybe also there's some output file redirection that could be done but
        idk.
    - Option 2 - Probably the right way.
      - Significantly rewrite the way the install page currently works to some
        how do these things as three separate steps before returning. 
        - I really don't know how to do this.
        - Right now the whole generator is dependant on that thread.start()
          call, then the auto install output spills out to the in mem global
          output object which can be read when requested from the api. 
        - Problem is how do I add sudoers rules then user them from same
          thread, can't apparently...
          - I don't want to have to restart the app in the middle of an
            install.
          - I don't want them to have to run install step 1 then go and run
            install step 2.
          - So how tf do I make this work....????????????





* Lock down other user sudoers rules more.
  - For example here's what I have as the current sudoers rule.
  - `(mcserver) NOPASSWD: /home/mcserver/Minecraft/mcserver, /usr/bin/watch, /usr/bin/tmux, /usr/bin/kill`
  - That's probably too open and could be locked down more.
    - At least the tmux cmd probably could be, will have to think more about
      the others...

* Add additional debug mode & verbose level for info printing.
  - In other words if the app is started in --debug mode, enable some
    additional info printing.
  - Also want to add a verbosity selector.
    - This will likely take the form of a main.conf param.
    - Maybe I'll do 1,2,3 or something to print more info at higher levels.

* Fix tests broken by changes to auto-install / default new user install.

* Remove tmux socket file purge option.
  - This was nice and hand for me as a developer while trying to figure out the
    socket file stuff.
  - However, I suspect it was of limited or of no use to most people
    downloading and installing the app.
    - Maybe if their tmux got messed up because of uninstalling / reinstalling
      a bunch before my code had all the bugs worked out, then they probably
      could've used it.
    - But the status indicator and live console logic that is based of finding
      the socket files has been figured out ever since I discovered where the
      base lgsm keeps the id files. 
    - Aka the issue this button was created for as been resolved and its now
      vestigial.

* Add new flag to `web-lgsm.py` to allow external gs_user.
  - This will prompt for a sudo password and the supplied gs_user value will be
    edited into the list of allowed gs_users in the `validate_gs_user.yml`
    playbook.
  - People will only need to run it with this flag when they're trying to add
    an existing game server that was installed as a system user which is
    non-standard.
    - By default the LGSM project themselves recommend users install server as
      new users where the username matches the main gs script. Aka Minecraft
      should be installed as the mcserver user, etc.
    - If someone installed minecraft as username `todd` and the web-lgsm is
      running as username `billybob`, that server can still be added and
      managed by the web interface.
    - Users in that predicament will just have to run the `web-lgsm.py` script
      with the new arg first.

* Write new tests for newly added features:
  - Need new tests for:
    - New settings page options:
      - install_create_new_user
      - passwordles_install
      - Make sure toggle changes config file.
    - Test new full auto install passwordless.
    - Test new full auto install as new user.
      - Rather than run 4 full installs (time consuming, resource intensive)
        I'm just going to run two full installs.
        - The first one will be exactly the same as it is now. Install
          minecraft as the web-lgsm system user.
        - The second one will be install as a new user with passwordless.
        - Aka test old default auto install vs new default auto install.
    - Test new delete for multi user, make sure it cleans up new user.


### v1.8.0 Pt 2.
---

* Add the ability to create multiple web interface users w/ different levels of
  permissions.
  - User requested this: https://github.com/BlueSquare23/web-lgsm/issues/19
  - I've also had it in the back of my mind since I start the project.
  - Fun fact, the sample code example flask app this project's structure is
    taken from is originally a multi user blog so shouldn't be too hard to
    borrow some code from that project and roll it into this.
  - I'm thinking first user that get's setup has admin privileges.
  - Then the admin user can create new users and assign permissions.
  - Additional web interface users can be setup as other admins or as user
    level users.
  - Only Admins can create / delete other users.
  - Non-admin level user permissions should be:
    - Can install new game servers: true/false
    - Can add existing game servers: true/false
    - Can manage game servers: checkbox list
      - Can edit cfgs: true/false
      - Can delete game server: true/false 
      - Controls they're allowed to use: checkbox list
      - All of the above (full control over game server): true/false
  - I kinda like the idea of having the colors in the main.conf. But yeah maybe
    I should just byte the bullet an put those in the db, then each user could
    have their own colors. Don't think that'll be in permissions mk1 though.

* Make config editor work for game servers owned by other system users.
  - Think I'll have to re-write / add-to the write new config data logic.
  - Right now it just writes to disk as the current user.
  - Instead I think I'll have it write to a tempfile with python's `tempfile`
    module, then sudo mv the tempfile into place, and lastly chown it to the
    new user.
  - Will be a little more complicated but shouldn't be too crazy.

* Put more error handling & set default values for main.conf parameters in
  code.
  - The idea here is if some user doesn't have some parameter set in their
    main.conf, or if their main.conf is totally mangled or something, then the
    app shouldn't fail catastrophically, which I think it kinda does rn.

* Make sure `web-lgsm.py --update` can deal with new folders owned as root.
  - Might need to just put a little sudo chown back to the user line for those
    before running git pull or backing up etc.

* Containerize Project!
  - Not entirely sure how to do this yet...
  - One problem I can foresee is not being able to control game servers
    installed outside of the container.
  - Could work for any games installed also in the container but that's rather
    limiting.
  - Also I have to brush up on my docker compose knowledge. 
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qKlZQX1Ums

* Add Support for game servers in containers!
  - User requested project support for game servers that are running in
    containers.
  - Issue: https://github.com/BlueSquare23/web-lgsm/issues/16
  - The LGSM themselves provide docker images of game servers.

* Allow multiple auto installs of same game server as new user, just increment
  the name.
  - So first mcserver install would just be mcserver but then a second one the
    user would be mcserver2, mcserver3, etc.

* Make game server name editable.

* Make install_path an optional main.conf parameter.
  - By default I want to set this to just `/home/<user>/<server_name>`.
  - But then allow people to put it where ever for their own purposes.
  - Write tests for this.

* Make install.sh setup npm pkgs at the end.
  - I'm using xterm.js and a plugin for them that can only be installed via
    npm.

* Remove support for python3.8 and add python3.13.
  - Python 3.8 is going eol Oct. 1st 2024.
  - That's also the same day python 3.13 is released.
  - So remove 3.8 from list in `.github/workflows/test.yml` and add 3.13.

* Add support for Ubuntu 24.04.
  - Ubuntu 24.04 is out now too. Can add that to `.github/workflows/test.yml`
    too.

* Identify targets for refactoring.
  - One such thing is all the overhead comments for functions n'@ can be turned
    into under hanging docstring to make the more _pythonic_.
  - If there are some really messy or iffy sections of the code where I hacked
    something together that really needed more thought, now is the time to try
    to identify those things.
  - Not fixing or changing anything just yet. Just want to review what I have
    and where its weak to better get an idea of how to fix it later.

## Backlog

* Possible rework things so that game server name in database is not unique,
  aka users can have more than one game server with the same name.
  - This DB Model line set's install name to be unique:
    `install_name = db.Column(db.String(150), unique=True)`
  - I'm thinking of allowing this possibly under the case where they're
    installed as different users.

* Add Python Selenium end-to-end tests to actually login and do a bunch of
  stuff in the web interface.
  - Try to thoroughly test site functionality, basically redo all of the same
    things the functional tests do through raw GET/POST requests, but instead
    through the selenium browser.

* Think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.
  - But this whole system is probably one of those targets for refactoring &
    rethinking.

* Add Restart/backup Scheduler.
  - User suggested this feature and I think its a good one.
    - https://github.com/BlueSquare23/web-lgsm/issues/20
  - The idea here would be to create a simple web interface to wrap up adding
    crontab entries. Then the actual restarts or backups will just be handled
    by the lgsm game server cli script itself.
  - I've got all of the above to work through first but I do like this idea and
    want to add it in.
  - Just a matter of time until I can get to it.

## Disclaimer

This document is basically just a rubber ducky for me while I change things.
Its just a scratch pad to jot things down on and throw ideas in when I maybe
don't have time to work on them right then.

It is the main way I keep track of what needs done for the project so it is a
highly in flux document on the dev branch. Not all of these ideas make sense or
are going to work or make it into the final release.
