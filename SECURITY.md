## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a security vulnerability via the [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting page for this project](https://github.com/BlueSquare23/web-lgsm/security/advisories/new)

Or if you prefer to reach out directly, you can do so via [my site's contact
form](https://johnlradford.io/contact.php).

Please keep responsible disclosure standards in mind when reporting issues.
All I ask is that you try to get in contact with me first before posting all
the juicy deets to a public github issues page.
