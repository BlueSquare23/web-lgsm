## Beta Version 1.3 Todos

* Add mechanism to kill long running watch sessions.
  - Maybe do some sort of timeout where if output hasn't been requested in x
    minutes kill any backgrounded watch threads.

* Continue writing tests to improve coverage.
  - Adjust test code to account for new async way of doing things.
  - Create test for login page to make sure it always redirects to setup if
    there's no user created yet.

* Setup Githup actions to run project tests.
  - I want the green badges!

* Add config editor.
  - Create config page where game server config file is loaded in and user can
    edit it.

* Add home page green or red circle ‚óè  to indicate if servers are on or off.
  - I think the way to implement this is to just check for the presence or
    absence of tmux sessions for each installed game server.
    - If the tmux session exists just assume its running.
      - Fair assumption to make because lgsm game servers never just leave an
        empty tmux session running.
