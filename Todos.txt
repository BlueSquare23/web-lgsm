## Beta Version 1.8.0 Todos

* Pipe install as new user config option out to settings page.

* Make /add page also automatically add the necessary sudoers rules.

* Make sure that the `install.sh` script chown's `playbooks/delete_user.yml` to
  root and chmod's it 644.
  - Otherwise I've just given the web-lgsm user passwordless root.
  - If the web-lgsm system user can both run that playbook without a password
    and also edit that playbook then technically they can run whatever they
    want as root on the system without a password and that's bad!

* Lock down other user sudoers rules more.
  - For example here's what I have as the current sudoers rule.
  - `(mcserver) NOPASSWD: /home/mcserver/Minecraft/mcserver, /usr/bin/watch, /usr/bin/tmux, /usr/bin/kill`
  - That's probably too open and could be locked down more.
    - At least the tmux cmd probably could be, will have to think more about
      the others...

* Add additional debug mode & verbose level for info printing.
  - In other words if the app is started in --debug mode, enable some
    additional info printing.
  - Also want to add a verbosity selector.
    - This will likely take the form of a main.conf param.
    - Maybe I'll do 1,2,3 or something to print more info at higher levels.

* Add the ability to create multiple web interface users w/ different levels of
  permissions.
  - User requested this: https://github.com/BlueSquare23/web-lgsm/issues/19
  - I've also had it in the back of my mind since I start the project.
  - Fun fact, the sample code example flask app this project's structure is
    taken from is originally a multi user blog so shouldn't be too hard to
    borrow some code from that project and roll it into this.
  - I'm thinking first user that get's setup has admin privileges.
  - Then the admin user can create new users and assign permissions.
  - Additional web interface users can be setup as other admins or as user
    level users.
  - Only Admins can create / delete other users.
  - Non-admin level user permissions should be:
    - Can install new game servers: true/false
    - Can add existing game servers: true/false
    - Can manage game servers: checkbox list
      - Can edit cfgs: true/false
      - Can delete game server: true/false 
      - Controls they're allowed to use: checkbox list
      - All of the above (full control over game server): true/false
  - I kinda like the idea of having the colors in the main.conf. But yeah maybe
    I should just byte the bullet an put those in the db, then each user could
    have their own colors. Don't think that'll be in permissions mk1 though.

* Make config editor work for game servers owned by other system users.
  - Think I'll have to re-write / add-to the write new config data logic.
  - Right now it just writes to disk as the current user.
  - Instead I think I'll have it write to a tempfile with python's `tempfile`
    module, then sudo mv the tempfile into place, and lastly chown it to the
    new user.
  - Will be a little more complicated but shouldn't be too crazy.

* Put more error handling & set default values for main.conf parameters in
  code.
  - The idea here is if some user doesn't have some parameter set in their
    main.conf, or if their main.conf is totally mangled or something, then the
    app shouldn't fail catastrophically, which I think it kinda does rn.

* Add Python Selenium end-to-end tests to actually login and do a bunch of
  stuff in the web interface.
  - Try to thoroughly test site functionality, basically redo all of the same
    things the functional tests do through raw GET/POST requests, but instead
    through the selenium browser.

* Containerize Project!
  - Not entirely sure how to do this yet...
  - One problem I can foresee is not being able to control game servers
    installed outside of the container.
  - Could work for any games installed also in the container but that's rather
    limiting.
  - Also I have to brush up on my docker compose knowledge.

* Add Support for game servers in containers!
  - User requested project support for game servers that are running in
    containers.
  - Issue: https://github.com/BlueSquare23/web-lgsm/issues/16
  - The LGSM themselves provide docker images of game servers.

* Allow multiple auto installs of same game server as new user, just increment
  the name.
  - So first mcserver install would just be mcserver but then a second one the
    user would be mcserver2, mcserver3, etc.

* Make game server name editable.

* Make install_path an optional main.conf parameter.
  - By default I want to set this to just `/home/<user>/<server_name>`.
  - But then allow people to put it where ever for their own purposes.

## Backlog

* Possible rework things so that game server name in database is not unique,
  aka users can have more than one game server with the same name.
  - This DB Model line set's install name to be unique:
    `install_name = db.Column(db.String(150), unique=True)`
  - I'm thinking of allowing this possibly under the case where they're
    installed as different users.

* Identify targets for refactoring.
  - One such thing is all the overhead comments for functions n'@ can be turned
    into under hanging docstring to make the more _pythonic_.
  - If there are some really messy or iffy sections of the code where I hacked
    something together that really needed more thought, now is the time to try
    to identify those things.
  - Not fixing or changing anything just yet. Just want to review what I have
    and where its weak to better get an idea of how to fix it later.

* Add passwordless sudo option.
  - Could create a config parameter to enable passwordless sudo option.
  - If user has proper sudoers rules in place could allow web-lgsm to run
    without any sudo pass input required.
  - Could even make this part of the `web-lgsm.py` script to enable / disable
    it.
  - Then could probably use the same create sudoers rule playbook or another
    similar one to automatically add the sudoers rules or remove them.

* Think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.
  - But this whole system is probably one of those targets for refactoring &
    rethinking.

* Add Restart/backup Scheduler.
  - User suggested this feature and I think its a good one.
    - https://github.com/BlueSquare23/web-lgsm/issues/20
  - The idea here would be to create a simple web interface to wrap up adding
    crontab entries. Then the actual restarts or backups will just be handled
    by the lgsm game server cli script itself.
  - I've got all of the above to work through first but I do like this idea and
    want to add it in.
  - Just a matter of time until I can get to it.
