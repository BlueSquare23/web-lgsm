## Beta Version 1.3 Todos

* Implement backend output thread + frontend Ajax for /install route.

* Remove global output object and replace it with game server specific output
  objects. Pipe object passing around accordingly.
  - Will allow for multiple output streams to be written for each game server.
  - Expand existing update-text-area.js code to only display output for
    specific game server.

* Adjust test code to account for new async way of doing things.

* Migrate del_server function into utils.

* Make default text area height a config / settings parameter.

* Continue writing tests to improve coverage.
  - Create test for login page to make sure it always redirects to setup if
    there's no user created yet.

* Setup Githup actions to run project tests.
  - I want the green badges!

* Add config editor.
  - Create config page where game server config file is loaded in and user can
    edit it.

* Add home page green or red circle ‚óè  to indicate if servers are on or off.
  - I think the way to implement this is to just check for the presence or
    absence of tmux sessions for each installed game server.
    - If the tmux session exists just assume its running.
      - Fair assumption to make because lgsm game servers never just leave an
        empty tmux session running.
