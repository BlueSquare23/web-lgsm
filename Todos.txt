## Beta Version 1.3 Todos

* Continue writing tests to improve coverage.
  - Restructure existing test code to improve granularity.
    - Instead of having one function per route, break it down more to have more
      test functions with more specific names.
      - Already started this with home page tests, continue with rest of tests.
  - Adjust test code to account for new async way of doing things.
    - Write code that triggers an output thread to run then check the output
      route is returning accurate json information.
  - Write tests for edit page!
    - Try editing file that doesn't meet validation.
  - Add tests for maxing out the input length of certain vars that get saved to
    the DB.
  - Create test for login page to make sure it always redirects to setup if
    there's no user created yet.

* Add mechanism to check if output page is still being requested or has been
  requested recently and if so do not kill the watch process(s).

* Spin project up on a blank ubuntu VM to test project setup and deployment.

* Setup Githup actions to run project tests.
  - I want the green badges!

* Take new screenshots of all pages to reflect latest changes for v1.3 release.

## Beta Version 1.4 Todos

* Create mechanism for exempting certain controls for certain game servers.
  - For example, the Update and Console commands for the Battlefield 1942
    server don't do anything.
    - They're not recognized by that lgsm server and so they just print the
      help menu.
      - Not terrible but just not polished.
  - Instead, I want to somehow hardcode exceptions like that, maybe via another
    json file with a list of game server exceptions. Then those options wont
    even be loaded on the page.
