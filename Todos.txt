## Beta Version 1.7.0 Todos

* Write some tests for new `web-lgsm.py` script.
  - Not exactly sure how to best do this because this is also going to be the
    script that launches the tests, and it already calls itself once and runs
    the tests through a series of subprocess shells.
    - I assume it will involve much forking and perhaps some acts of computer
      heresy...
      - Its tests, who gives a shit as long as they run and fail when they're
        supposed to.

* Replace test running logic in `.github/workflows/test.yml` with a call to
  `web-lgsm.py --test_full`.
  - I want to run all tests through this main script.
  - Then I can ditch the env vars in the test.yml file.
    - Aka just two places where the version number is kept, needs updated. Once
      in the project files and one in the test files.
  - Really should've done this from the beginning, but ehh live and learn.

* Make it so that home page somehow shows if can't connect to backend server
  cause its down.
  - With recent changes to js, no longer goes flatline when cant connect.
  - So I'm thinking some other sort of indicator to say backend offline, in
    case someone just leaves the homepage up and then the backend gunicorn
    server gets shutoff or crashes.

* Look into make config editor work through sudo.

* Work on Idea Phase ideas.

* With v1.7.0 release, introduce a proper Semantic Versioning schema.
  - More info: https://semver.org/


## In Idea Phase...

* Explore putting new installations in their own user directory like the LGSM
  recommends to begin with.
  - Yeah its a good point for process isolation game servers should be running
    as their own user.
  - Ngl, I've always just kept all of my game servers under the same user but
    I should probably make this a bit more legit and up to spec.
  - I might make this an optional config param. Something like
    `default_install_new_user = yes` or something idk.

* Look into adding a debug mode to conf / app.
  - So if debug in conf is set to true it would just enable debug logging which
    could be used to output what functions are doing n'@.

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feasible /
  worthwhile.

## Backlog

* Do a thorough refactor.
  - Spend some time just re-reading my own code looking for bugs / improvements.
  - More unit testing will probably help with this.

* Think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.

* Add support for containerized game server instances.
