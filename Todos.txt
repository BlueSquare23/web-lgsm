## Beta Version 1.8.0 Todos

* Look into make config editor work through sudo.

## In Idea Phase...

* Explore putting new installations in their own user directory like the LGSM
  recommends to begin with.
  - Yeah its a good point for process isolation game servers should be running
    as their own user.
  - Ngl, I've always just kept all of my game servers under the same user but
    I should probably make this a bit more legit and up to spec.
  - I might make this an optional config param. Something like
    `default_install_new_user = yes` or something idk.

* Look into adding a debug mode to conf / app.
  - So if debug in conf is set to true it would just enable debug logging which
    could be used to output what functions are doing n'@.

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feasible /
  worthwhile.

## Backlog

* Do a thorough refactor.
  - Spend some time just re-reading my own code looking for bugs / improvements.
  - More unit testing will probably help with this.

* Think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.

* Add support for containerized game server instances.
