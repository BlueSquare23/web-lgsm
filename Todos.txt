## Beta Version 1.5 Todos

* Make boxes rounded.
  - Ex) Apply corrner rounding to about page box and login form boxes.

* See if there is a way to configure github actions playbook to only fire off
  tests if changed file(s) ends in *py, *sh, *html, *css, *js, *json.
  - No need to spin up five containers and run all the project tests because I
    updated and pushed changes to the Readme.

* Convert as much shell code as possible to python.
  - This includes both shell code within the app and stand alone scripts.
  - Not everything has to be python, install and init scripts will probably
    remain shell because they're not very complex.

* Do a thorough refactor.
  - Spend some time just re-reading my own code looking for bugs / improments.
  - More unit testing will probably help with this.

## In Idea Phase...

* Perhaps think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.

* Allow web interface to work with lgsm installations owned by different users.
  - Add config / settings option to "allow installs owned by other users".
  - Possible use sudo to accomplish this.
    - I'm thinking add sudoers rule allowing web-lgms user to run cmds as other
      user without a password.
    - Then if the game server is owned by another user cmds would be wrapped in:
      `sudo -u otheruser "cmd"`

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feezable /
  worthwhile.
