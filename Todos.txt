## Beta Version 1.6 Todos

* Do a thorough refactor.
  - Spend some time just re-reading my own code looking for bugs / improvements.
  - More unit testing will probably help with this.

* Test around with realtime networking stats more.
  - Right now the disk cpu and mem pie charts are fine. Those metrics don't
    really change a lot second by second. However, network data is different.
  - For the network data I would really like to have a psuedo realtime graph.
    and if I can figure it out for the network data might do it with the other
    metrics as well.

## In Idea Phase...

* Allow web interface to work with lgsm installations owned by different users.
  - Add config / settings option to "allow installs owned by other users".
  - Possible use sudo to accomplish this.
    - I'm thinking add sudoers rule allowing web-lgms user to run cmds as other
      user without a password.
    - Then if the game server is owned by another user cmds would be wrapped in:
      `sudo -u otheruser "cmd"`

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feezable /
  worthwhile.

## Backlog

* Think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.
