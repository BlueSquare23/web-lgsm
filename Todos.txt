* Look into hardcoding command options.
  - Currently command options are generated on fly per server.
  - Might save time / be easier to just hard code them.
    - Have to look at a bunch of different lgsm server and see if any of them
      have different special options. 
    - Also check if the shortenings are the same across the board.
      - st for start, sp for stop, ect.
  - Would make validation much easier.
  - Improves initial load times.
  - Reduces calls to os.popen.
  - Would render lot of code existing unnecessary and allow it to be deleted!

* Improve live console tmux capture pane shell exec code so it is continuous.
  - Rn console only captures the last few lines of the tmux pane.
    - Need to click it again to get next few lines.
  - I want to make this continuously displaying the live tmux console to the
    output iframe.
    - Perhaps write python shell script wrapper to accomplish this.

* Look into / play around with alternate means of generating sudo TTY ticket
  for auto install.

* General refactor!
  - Remove unnecessary indents!
  - Remove silly unused or redundant code.
  - Do some renaming.
  - Fix up / add / update comments.
  - Prue.

* Refactor main route code and utils code to secure RCE functions.
  - Scrapped the idea of universal RCE function. This project does too much
    shell communication to all go through one function.
  - Afaict cant have one function do both realtime rce and wait till complete
    proc open.
  - Instead just validate and sanitize heavily.
    - Preset hardcoded list of args and server names would help with this.

* Harden /add page checks to lock down directory traversal attempts.
  - Only allow dirs under pwd.

* Add JS to tell if iframe is populated yet or not, and if not but after
  controls button onclick, then show spinner.
  - In other words, if its between the time when the user presses a controls
    button and when the output starts spilling into the iframe, then use some
    js to show a loading... & spinners.
  - POST to iframe currently has no status indictor as to when output is
    coming. Can be an uncomfortable amount of time where nothing happens
    before output comes back, even though output is coming in realtime.
    - First few lines may be buffered??? Idk have to do some goog in.

* Add toggle Setting to keep / remove server install files on delete.
  - Use python configparser lib to setup site config.
  
* Make text color an adjustable config / setting.

* Double check for template injection!
  - Make sure all input is checked before putting in DB.

* Fix firefox home page toggle bug.
  - Rn in firefox when you go to toggle the delete switch it just clicks the
    underlying a href and goes to the server page. Doesn't do that in chrome.
    - I'm probably using bootstrap wrong.

* Setup Unit Testing.
  - Test all endpoints to make sure they can handle null data.

* Write easy install script.

* Fix up Readme.
  - Add easy install instructions.
  - Add pretty pictures of app in action!
