## Beta Version 1.7 Todos

* Look into make config editor work through sudo.

* Make jQuery for charts more efficient.
  - Right now its generating hella requests because its requesting the api
    endpoint 4 times a second (each chart getting its own copy of the json).
  - This is because I'm not any good at javascript and it works. But yeah can
    probably be refactored to not be so inefficient.
  - With 1 request to get the json for all of the charts that need it.

* Work on Idea Phase ideas.

* With v1.7.0 release, introduce a proper Semantic Versioning schema.
  - More info: https://semver.org/

## In Idea Phase...

* Create a single point of entry script for whole project.
  - So right now I have the init script and the debug script and the setup as a
    systemd service script and I was thinking of adding another script for
    resetting the web portal login pass.
  - Instead of having all these be differnt scripts, roll them all into one,
    single point of entry, `web-lgsm` script.
  - The `install.sh` script can still be its own thing.
  - But pretty much everything else in the script dir can be controlled by one
    main script for the whole project.

* Explore putting new installations in their own user directory like the LGSM
  recommends to begin with.
  - Yeah its a good point for process isolation game servers should be running
    as their own user.
  - Ngl, I've always just kept all of my game servers under the same user but
    I should probably make this a bit more legit and up to spec.
  - I might make this an optional config param. Something like
    `default_install_new_user = yes` or something idk.

* Look into adding a debug mode to conf / app.
  - So if debug in conf is set to true it would just enable debug logging which
    could be used to output what functions are doing n'@.

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feasible /
  worthwhile.

## Backlog

* Do a thorough refactor.
  - Spend some time just re-reading my own code looking for bugs / improvements.
  - More unit testing will probably help with this.

* Think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.

* Add support for containerized game server instances.
