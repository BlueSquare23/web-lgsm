## Beta Version 1.4 Todos

* Continue expanding tests.
  - Write proper tests for a full game server install.
    - Install Battlefeild 1942 or something small.
    - Check that daemon thread is running during install.
    - Check that output api is returning json.
      - Rinse and repeat for command(s) on controls page.
      - Can't test daemon thread till real server is installed.
  - Write unit tests for functions in utils.py file.

* Create mechanism for exempting certain controls for certain game servers.
  - For example, the Update and Console commands for the Battlefield 1942
    server don't do anything.
    - They're not recognized by that lgsm server and so they just print the
      help menu.
      - Not terrible but just not polished.
  - Instead, I want to somehow hardcode exceptions like that, maybe via another
    json file with a list of game server exceptions. Then those options wont
    even be loaded on the page.

* Think about implementing reaper daemon thread to cleanup lingering watch
  processes if output route hasn't been requested recently.
  - Currently I'm using requests for other routes to kill the daemonized watch
    processes if output hasn't been requested recently.
    - This has the downside of leaving a watch process running if someone
      closes app directly by just leaving the live console output on the
      controls page.

* Setup automatic update system.
  - Create optional toggle for auto updates in the config file and on the
    settings page.
  - Then setup means by which to check once weekly (or upon request) for new
    updates.
    - If the version number is different from the most recent release version
      then pull in & install the most recent changes.
  - Create update script for running the updates manually.
    - Remember to not clobber existing user main.conf files during updates.
