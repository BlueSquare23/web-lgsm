## Beta Version 1.6 Todos

* Add new aesthetic config options to /settings page.
  - Just like the existing settings, we'll want to setup a pass through so the
    settings page will change the config file which will intern change the
    appearance / behavior of the app.
  - Need new setting form input fields for:
    - graphs_primary: Color picker
    - graphs_secondary: Color picker
    - show_stats: Toggle / Checkbox (Bool)
  - Add tests for these new settings dialog options.

* Test new code.
  - Test api route is returning valid json.
  - Investigate if frontend testing to see if its worth it for the new graphs.
    - If they're robust enough on their own and people don't report any issues
      with them then they might just sorta remain untested.
    - ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

* Implement allow users to add existing installations owned by different system
  users.
  - Use sudo rule like the following to accomplish this:
    user1 ALL=(user2) NOPASSWD: /home/mcserver/mcserver
  - Add python code to accomplish this into utils function.
    - Already have example code for this in the form of `sudoers.py`
    - Just need to stitch it into utils.py
  - Will need to remove restriction for installing outside of users home dir.
  - Will need to expand database model to allow user field.
    - This might break backward compatibility with earlier versions :(
    - For now I'll try to be smart about it and perhaps the app can support
      databases where the installs are missing a user field, and it'll just
      assume that's the system users the web app is running as.
  - Will need to tweak controls page logic to check if web-lgsm user is not the
    same as game server install user and if so run server cmds through sudo.
  - Will need to tweak add existing game server page 

* Do light refactor of new code and old code. Look over some core parts with
  fresh eyes to see if I'm doing anything obviously stupid anywhere or just
  tweak around and make small improvements.

* Add a new gifs for the home & controls page and update Readme.
  - Replace old home page png with new imbeded gif.
  - Replace old install page gif with new one that includes user.

## In Idea Phase...

* Explore putting new installations in their own user directory like the LGSM
  recommends to begin with.
  - Yeah its a good point for process isolation game servers should be running
    as their own user.
  - Ngl, I've always just kept all of my game servers under the same user but
    I should probably make this a bit more legit and up to spec.

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feasible /
  worthwhile.

## Backlog

* Do a thorough refactor.
  - Spend some time just re-reading my own code looking for bugs / improvements.
  - More unit testing will probably help with this.

* Think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.
