## Beta Version 1.3 Todos

* Continue writing tests to improve coverage.
  - Adjust test code to account for new async way of doing things.
  - Write tests for edit page!
    - Try editing file that doesn't meet validation.
  - Add tests for maxing out the input length of certain vars that get saved to
    the DB and adjust route code to guard against it.
  - Create test for login page to make sure it always redirects to setup if
    there's no user created yet.

* Refactor / Cleanup Code!
  - Determine unified way to do subprocess spawning / communication.
    - Currently using a bunch of different ways to do it and they're all
      disjointed.
  - Remove dead whitespace.
  - Standardize / rethink some naming. For example I have a lot of variations
    of variables named some variation of something_conf, config, cnf, ect.
    Instead stick to just one naming convention for example something_cnf and
    then try to make the var names as specific as possible.
  - Need to read up on subprocess and test around with best practices because
    as of rn I'm certain I'm doing things wrong.
  - Standardize naming conventions for html files. Remove jS camel case from
    name="" flags in html files. Change it to hyphen-separated convention.

* Improve error handling around reading in json files in case contents within
  gets mangled by user.

* Spin project up on a blank ubuntu VM to test project setup and deployment.

* Setup Githup actions to run project tests.
  - I want the green badges!

* Take new screenshots of all pages to reflect latest changes for v1.3 release.

## Beta Version 1.4 Todos

* Create mechanism for exempting certain controls for certain game servers.
  - For example, the Update and Console commands for the Battlefield 1942
    server don't do anything.
    - They're not recognized by that lgsm server and so they just print the
      help menu.
      - Not terrible but just not polished.
  - Instead, I want to somehow hardcode exceptions like that, maybe via another
    json file with a list of game server exceptions. Then those options wont
    even be loaded on the page.
