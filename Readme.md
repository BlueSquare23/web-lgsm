# Web LGSM

## Main Idea

This project is intended to be an easy to use web interface for the [Linux Game
Server Manager (LGSM)](https://linuxgsm.com/) command line tool. The LGSM is a
fantastic tool for installing and administering game servers via the CLI.
However, some users would rather manage their game server through a web
interface. That is what this project attempts to be.

## Installation

TBD

## Usage & Liability

I claim no liability for any injury or damages that may result from the use or
abuse of this piece of software. Use at your own risk! I have tried to take
security precautions when building this this app to prevent it from being
horribly abused. However, please note I am an amateur programmer and this app
is fundamentally sorta suss. It is a web portal for wrapping shell commands.
That is very big target for haxzorz!
