## Beta Version 1.6 Todos

* Do a thorough refactor.
  - Spend some time just re-reading my own code looking for bugs / improvements.
  - More unit testing will probably help with this.

* Test new code.
  - Test api route is returning valid json.
  - Unit test new get_server_stats() functions.
  - Investigate if frontend testing to see if its worth it for the new graphs.
    - If they're robust enough on their own and people don't report any issues
      with them then they might just sorta remain untested.
    - ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

* Impliment allow users to add existing installations owned by different system
  users.
  - Use sudo rule like the following to accomplish this:
    user1 ALL=(user2) NOPASSWD: /home/mcserver/mcserver
  - Add python code to accomplish this into utils function.
    - Already have example code for this in the form of `sudoers.py`
    - Just need to stitch it into utils.py
  - Will need to remove restriction for installing outside of users home dir.
  - Will need to expand database model to allow user field.
    - This might break backward compatability with earlier versions :(
    - For now I'll try to be smart about it and perhaps the app can support
      databases where the installs are missing a user field, and it'll just
      assume that's the system users the web app is running as.
  - Will need to tweak controls page logic to check if web-lgsm user is not the
    same as game server install user and if so run server cmds through sudo.

## In Idea Phase...

* Explore putting new installations in their own user directory like the LGSM
  reccomends to begin with.
  - Yeah its a good point for process isolation game servers should be running
    as their own user.
  - Ngl, I've always just kept all of my game servers under the same user but
    I should probably make this a bit more legit and up to spec.

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feezable /
  worthwhile.

## Backlog

* Think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.
