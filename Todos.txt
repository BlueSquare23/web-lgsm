* Look into hardcoding command options.
  - Currently command options are generated on fly per server.
  - Might save time / be easier to just hard code them.
    - Have to look at a bunch of different lgsm server and see if any of them
      have different special options. 
    - Also check if the shortenings are the same across the board.
      - st for start, sp for stop, ect.

* General refactor!
  - Remove silly unused or redundant code.
  - Do some renaming.
  - Fix up / add / update comments.
  - Prue.

* Refactor all RCE utils into a single universal secure RCE function.
  - Just pass in list of args.
  - Validate ALL args going into RCE function!
  - There are only so many things that can be run.
  - Do NOT allow arbitrary user input into RCE function!!!
    - Still mulling over solution for sudo password.
    - Dev build is a mess rn because I'm just working things out.
    - Goal is to have prod v-sanitized and clean!

* Harden /add page checks to lock down directory traversal attempts.
  - Only allow dirs under pwd.

* Add JS to tell if iframe is populated yet or not, and if not but after
  controls button onclick, then show spinner.
  - In other words, if its between the time when the user presses a controls
    button and when the output starts spilling into the iframe, then use some
    js to show a loading... & spinners.
  - POST to iframe currently has no status indictor as to when output is
    coming. Can be an uncomfortable amount of time where nothing happens
    before output comes back, even though output is coming in realtime.
    - First few lines may be buffered??? Idk have to do some goog in.

* Add toggle Setting to keep / remove server install files on delete.
  - Use python configparser lib to setup site config.
  
* Make text color an adjustable config / setting.

* Double check for template injection!
  - Make sure all input is checked before putting in DB.

* Setup Unit Testing.
  - Test all endpoints to make sure they can handle null data.

* Write easy install script.

* Fix up Readme.
  - Add easy install instructions.
  - Add pretty pictures of app in action!
