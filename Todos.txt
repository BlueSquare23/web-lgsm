## Beta Version 1.6 Todos

* Do a thorough refactor.
  - Spend some time just re-reading my own code looking for bugs / improvements.
  - More unit testing will probably help with this.

* Add in basic game server stats interface.
  - Just basic metrics like:
    - Mem Usage
    - Disk Usage
    - CPU Usage
  - Real time graphs would be cool eventually, but lets start small and just
    focus on getting the values piped to the frontend.

## In Idea Phase...

* Perhaps think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.

* Allow web interface to work with lgsm installations owned by different users.
  - Add config / settings option to "allow installs owned by other users".
  - Possible use sudo to accomplish this.
    - I'm thinking add sudoers rule allowing web-lgms user to run cmds as other
      user without a password.
    - Then if the game server is owned by another user cmds would be wrapped in:
      `sudo -u otheruser "cmd"`

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feezable /
  worthwhile.
