## Beta Version 1.5 Todos

* Perhaps think of way to do watch thread timeout. Not terribly important
  - kill_watchers gets the job done alright for rn.

* Allow web interface to work with lgsm installations owned by different users.
  - Add config / settings option to "allow installs owned by other users".
  - I'm thinking doing this by creating a web-lgsm group and chowning the
    necessary game server dir to be `other_user:web-lgsm`.

* Explore if containerizing project with docker is at all feezable /
  worthwhile.
