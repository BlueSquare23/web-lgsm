## Beta Version 1.3 Todos

* Add config editor.
  - Create config page where game server config file is loaded in and user can
    edit it.
  - Create an /edit page with a textarea input where file contents are read
    from and written into.
  - I'm going to try to use the details menu to get the config file locations
    for each game server.
    - https://docs.linuxgsm.com/configuration/game-server-config
  - This might be tricky to get the parsing 100% correct especially considering
    I don't know how it handles game servers with multiple configs yet...
  - So I might be forced to abandon this approach in favor of something of
    more hardcoded.
    - Would require a lot more work.
    - Would have to install every game server and run details to manually craft
      a json file or something.
    - Going to play around with things before making any final decisions.

* Continue writing tests to improve coverage.
  - Adjust test code to account for new async way of doing things.
  - Create test for login page to make sure it always redirects to setup if
    there's no user created yet.

* Setup Githup actions to run project tests.
  - I want the green badges!

* Take new screenshots of all pages to reflect latest changes for v1.3 release.

## Beta Version 1.4 Todos

* Create mechanism for exempting certain controls for certain game servers.
  - For example, the Update and Console commands for the Battlefield 1942
    server don't do anything.
    - They're not recognized by that lgsm server and so they just print the
      help menu.
      - Not terrible but just not polished.
  - Instead, I want to somehow hardcode exceptions like that, maybe via another
    json file with a list of game server exceptions. Then those options wont
    even be loaded on the page.
