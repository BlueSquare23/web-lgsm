## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a security vulnerability to me via [my site's contact
form](https://johnlradford.io/contact.php).

If you don't hear back from me for a few days feel free to open up a [github
issue for this project](https://github.com/BlueSquare23/web-lgsm/issues/new).
Just keep the details to a minimun. "I found a critical security bug" is good
enough. Send any POC's to me in private first please and give me like a week or
so to respond.

Keep responsible disclosure standards in mind when reporting issues. Please
just try to get in contact with me first before posting all the juicy deets to
the github issues page.
