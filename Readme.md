# Web LGSM

## Main Idea

This project is intended to be an easy to use web interface for the [Linux Game
Server Manager (LGSM)](https://linuxgsm.com/) command line tool. The LGSM is a
fantastic tool for installing and administering game servers via the CLI.
However, some users would rather manage their game server through a web
interface. That is what this project attempts to be.
