* General refactor!
  - Remove silly unused or redundant code.
  - Do some renaming.
  - Fix up / add / update comments.
  - Prue.

* Refactor all RCE utils into a single universal secure RCE function.
  - Just pass in list of args.
  - Validate ALL args going into RCE function!
  - There are only so many things that can be run.
  - Do NOT allow arbitrary user input into RCE function!!!
    - Still mulling over solution for sudo password.
    - Dev build is a mess rn because I'm just working things out.
    - Goal is to have prod v-sanitized and clean!

* Come up with secure solution for auto install requiring sudo access.
  - Auto-install is broken until I can pipe sudo password down to shell.
    - Sudo access required to install necessary game server dependencies.

* Harden /add page checks to lock down directory traversal attempts.
  - Only allow dirs under pwd.

* Preform additional checks to ensure lgsm script files are the files they're
  expected to be.
  - Perhaps compare checksums against online versions.

* Add JS to tell if iframe is populated yet or not, and if not but after
  controls button onclick, then show spinner.
  - In other words, if its between the time when the user presses a controls
    button and when the output starts spilling into the iframe, then use some
    js to show a loading... & spinners.
  - POST to iframe currently has no status indictor as to when output is
    comming. Can be an uncomfortable amount of time where nothing happens
    before output comes back, even though output is comming in realtime.
    - First few lines may be buffered??? Idk have to do some goog in.

* Add toggle Setting to keep / remove server install files on delete.
  - Use python configparser lib to setup site config.
  
* Make text color an adjustable config / setting.

* Double check for template injection!
  - Make sure all input is checked before putting in DB.

* Setup Unit Testing.
  - Test all endpoints to make sure they can handle null data.

* Write easy install script.

* Fix up Readme.
  - Add easy install instructions.
  - Add pretty pictures of app in action!
